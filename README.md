# libigl example project

A blank project example showing how to use libigl and cmake. Feel free and
encouraged to copy or fork this project as a way of starting a new personal
project using libigl.

## See the tutorial first

Then build, run and understand the [libigl
tutorial](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/).

## Dependencies

The only dependencies are stl, eigen, [libigl](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/) and
the dependencies of the `igl::opengl::glfw::Viewer`.

The cmake build system will attempt to find libigl according to environment variables (e.g., `LIBIGL`) and searching in common desitinations (e.g., `/usr/local/libigl/`). If you haven't installed libigl before, we recommend you to clone a copy of libigl right here:

    cd libigl-example-project/
    git clone https://github.com/libigl/libigl.git

## Compile

Compile this project using the standard cmake routine:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This should find and build the dependencies and create a `example_bin` binary.

## Run

From within the `build` directory just issue:

    ./example

A glfw app should launch displaying a 3D cube.
